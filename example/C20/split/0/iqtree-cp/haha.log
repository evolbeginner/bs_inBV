Developed by Bui Quang Minh, Nguyen Lam Tung, Olga Chernomor,
Heiko Schmidt, Dominik Schrempf, Michael Woodhams.

Host:    mic-r750 (AVX512, FMA3, 1007 GB RAM)
Command: /mnt/hd1/home/sishuo/software/phylo/iqtree/source/v1.6.12/iqtree -redo -s ../../../../combined.phy -m LG+G -te iqtree.treefile -pre haha
Seed:    499826 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Sat Dec 27 12:59:05 2025
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (128 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 128 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.

NOTE: t7 is identical to t1 but kept for subsequent analysis
NOTE: 1 identical sequences (see below) will be ignored for subsequent analysis
NOTE: t17 (identical to t1) is ignored but added at the end
