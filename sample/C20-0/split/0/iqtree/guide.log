NOTE: State(s) R, N, D, C, E, G, I, K, F, P, Y, V not present in alignment and thus removed from Markov process to prevent numerical problems
NOTE: 12 states (see above) are not present and thus removed from Markov process to prevent numerical problems

WARNING: 5 undefined/negative branch lengths are initialized with parsimony
WARNING: 8 threads for alignment length 7 will slow down analysis
Model LG4M+G is alias for MIX{LG4M1,LG4M2,LG4M3,LG4M4}*G4+G
NOTE: both +G and *G were specified, continue with *G

NOTE: 0 MB RAM (0 GB) is required!
